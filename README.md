# Geometric complexity
This repository contains the code for the analyses of

Novak & Stouffer (in review) *Geometric complexity and the information-theoretic comparison of functional-response models.* bioRxiv

Please email Mark Novak (mark.novak@oregonstate.edu) and Daniel Stouffer (daniel.stouffer@canterbury.ac.nz) with any questions.

## Organization
All analyses were performed in Mathematica _v. 12.1.1.0_ using its notebook (_.nb_) format.

#### [code](code/)
The notebooks for recreating the main analyses and figures of the paper are:
- _GeomComp_Compute.nb_ computes the geometric complexities of all considered models for all considered experimental designs of the specified design-type.
- _GeomComp_Plotting.nb_ produces the visualizations of the paper's main results.

The two notebooks are used repeatedly for each experimental design type (i.e. for analyzing logarithmic (= _GoldenRatio_) or _Arithmetic_ prey and predator abundance spacings) as well as for the analyses using alternative minimum or maximum number-of-prey-eaten constraints. Which design type or prey-eaten constraint is to be analyzed is specified manually at the top of the _GeomComp_Compute.nb_ notebook (for design type) or in the argument of the _GeomComplex[]_ function (for the prey-eaten constraint) defined in that notebook.  Which results are to be plotted by _GeomComp_Plotting.nb_ is specified by changing the directory locations of the results and export folders.

Additional notebooks:
- _ParamComp_2ndTerm.nb_ produces Fig. 1 visualizing FIA's parametric complexity term as a function of sample size.
- _GeomComp_H2MM.nb_ produces Fig. 2 comparing Holling and Michaelis-Menten formulations.
- _Identifiability.nb_ produces Fig. S.1 visualizing the identifiability of all considered models as a function of experimental design.

Further notebooks in the [other](code/other) directory were used for visualizing or exploring specific functional-response models or were useful in the development of the primary analyses.

#### [docs](docs)
The [docs](docs) directory contains _pdf_ printouts of the Mathematica notebook files.

#### [figs](figs)
The [figs](figs) directory contains all figures of the main text and supplementary materials, organized by design type.


#### [results](results)
The [results](results) directory contains all files in _.txt_ format exported by _GeomComp_Compute.nb_, organized by design type. The results include the geometric complexity estimates for each model.  The directory also includes _Design___._txt_ files that summarize all considered experimental designs (i.e. prey and predator abundance combinations) as depicted in the paper's supplementary materials.
